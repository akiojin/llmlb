# cargo-audit configuration
#
# NOTE:
# - This repository currently uses SQLite only (no MySQL driver at runtime).
# - `cargo audit` can report RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa) via `sqlx-mysql`, but
#   `cargo tree -i rsa` shows it is not in the feature-resolved graph for llmlb.
# - If MySQL support is enabled in the future, revisit this ignore.

[advisories]
ignore = [
  "RUSTSEC-2023-0071", # rsa: no fixed upgrade; unreachable unless sqlx-mysql feature is enabled
]
